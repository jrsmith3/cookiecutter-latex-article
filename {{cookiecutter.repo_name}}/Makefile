### Latex.Make
# Author: Jason Hiebel
# This version of this file was taken from the repo found at 
# http://github.com/jrsmith3/latex_template

# This is a simple makefile for compiling LaTeX documents.

# Targets:
#    default : compiles the document in to three formats (DVI -> PS -> PDF)
#    display : displays the compiled document in a common PDF viewer.
#              (Linux = Evince, OSX = OS Set Default)
#    clean   : removes the build/ directory holding temporary files


# Set PROJECT to the name of the .tex file to build.
PROJECT = main

default: build/$(PROJECT).pdf

display: default
	(${PDFVIEWER} build/$(PROJECT).pdf &)

lpr: default
	lpr build/$(PROJECT).pdf &

wc: default
	@ echo "Word count:"
	@ pdftotext build/$(PROJECT).pdf - | wc -w
	@ echo "\r"

### Compilation Flags
LATEX_FLAGS  = -halt-on-error -quiet -output-directory build/

TEXMFOUTPUT = build/


### File Types (for dependancies)
TEX_FILES = $(shell find . -name '*.tex')
BIB_FILES = $(shell find . -name '*.bib')
STY_FILES = $(shell find . -name '*.sty')
CLS_FILES = $(shell find . -name '*.cls')
BST_FILES = $(shell find . -name '*.bst')
EPS_FILES = $(shell find . -name '*.eps')


### Standard PDF Viewers

UNAME := $(shell uname)

ifeq ($(UNAME), Linux)
PDFVIEWER = okular
endif
ifeq ($(UNAME), Darwin)
PDFVIEWER = open
endif


### Clean
# This target cleans the temporary files generated by the tex programs in
# use. All temporary files generated by this makefile will be placed in build/
# so cleanup is easy.

clean::
	rm -rf build/


### Core Latex Generation
# Performs the typical build process for latex generations so that all
# references are resolved correctly. If adding components to this run-time
# always take caution and implement the worst case set of commands.
# Example: latex, bibtex, latex, latex
#
# Note the use of order-only prerequisites (prerequisites following the |).
# Order-only prerequisites do not affect the target -- if the order-only
# prerequisite has changed and none of the normal prerequisites have changed
# then this target IS NOT run.
